MongoDB Realm has open-source SDKs available for most popular languages, frameworks, and platforms. Each SDK is language-idiomatic and includes:

- The core database APIs for creating and working with on-device databases.
- The APIs you need for connecting to the Realm backend so you can make
  use of server-side features like [Sync](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sync/learn/overview/#std-label-sync),
  [Authentication](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/authentication/#std-label-users-and-authentication),
  [Functions](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/functions/#std-label-functions),
  [Triggers](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/triggers/overview/#std-label-trigger-types),
  and [more](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/cloud/).
